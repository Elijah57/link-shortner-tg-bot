# link-shortner-tg-bot

Out of boredom and a lack of motivation to proceed with my ongoing project, SmartLearn, I decided to create a Telegram bot that runs a Flask app to shorten URL links. I mostly view the Telegram platform as a place to build bots that automate certain tasks for me.

To build this, I needed a database to store the long URLs (values) and lookups for the URLs (keys). I also wanted the database to have fast retrieval and low latency for a better user experience. Although, in my wildest expectations, this would be used as an API, so only developers would use it, Redis Cache fits well for this application.

Donâ€™t know about Redis??, check [Here !](https://redis.io)

# How to replicate

> 1. Ensure you have python installed on your macnhine (>3.8) with the latest version of pip. Also, for this project, i used a Redis cache, to store lookups (keys) for the long urls. You could use a free server from upstash or ...(do your findings)

> 2. create a virtual environment, if you want to (do this!1)
`python -m venv .env`

> 3. Activate the virtual environment with this command
(windows) `source .env/Scripts/activate`
(Linux) `source .env/bin/activate`

> 4. Install the requirements
`pip install requirements.txt` 

> 5. next is to copy .env.examples and edit it with your values. I used a redis cache, for fast retrival of the url.
